## 2. Create Your First Supabase Project

Enter the name of the organization, and select "New Project" and assign a name, password, and region to your first Supabase project. You will receive connection details such as the project API for your new Supabase project, so be sure to save them for later use when connecting to your PostgreSQL project.

## 3. Connect to Your Supabase Project

After deploying the database, you can use it as a spreadsheet with the Table Editor or utilize the SQL Editor for more advanced functions. You can also interact with the Supabase database using client libraries.
