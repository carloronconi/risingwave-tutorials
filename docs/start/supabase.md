# Install PostgreSQL (via Supabase)

Supabase provides a PostgreSQL database for your project along with a range of functionalities, including authentication, backups, instant APIs, Edge Functions, real-time subscriptions, storage, and vector embeddings.

Follow these steps to set up a PostgreSQL database using Supabase:

## 1. Sign Up for a Supabase Account

Start by signing up for a free Supabase account, which will grant you access to our PostgreSQL services. To create your account, visit [Supabase Account](https://supabase.com/dashboard/sign-up).

## 2. Create Your First Supabase Project

Select "New Project" and assign a name, password, and region to your first Supabase project. You will receive connection details such as the project API for your new Supabase project, so be sure to save them for later use when connecting to your PostgreSQL project.

## 3. Connect to Your Supabase Project

After deploying the database, you can use it as a spreadsheet with the Table Editor or utilize the SQL Editor for more advanced functions. You can also interact with the Supabase database using client libraries.

For more information about Supabase, please refer to [Supabase's official documentation](https://supabase.com/docs).
