## 3. Set Up a Kafka Topic

After creating your Kafka cluster, set up a Kafka topic effortlessly. Upstash Kafka provides default configurations for the number of partitions and retention policy, simplifying the setup process.

## 4. Connect and Interact with Your Kafka Cluster

You're now ready to connect to your Kafka cluster using various Kafka clients. These clients enable you to both produce and consume data from your Kafka topic. This step empowers you to create real-time event-driven applications and services both using Kafka and RisingWave.
