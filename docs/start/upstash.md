# Upstash Kafka Quick Start

Follow these four easy steps to get started with Upstash Kafka:

## 1. Sign Up for an Upstash Cloud Account

Start by signing up for a free Upstash Cloud account, which will grant you access to our Kafka services. To create your account, visit [Upstash Cloud Account](https://console.upstash.com/kafka).

## 2. Create a Kafka Cluster

Once you're logged in, create your Kafka cluster with the following details:

- **Cluster Name**: Give your Kafka cluster a unique name for identification.
- **Region**: Choose the region where your Kafka cluster will be hosted.
- **Cluster Type**: Select the cluster type that suits your needs.

## 3. Set Up a Kafka Topic

After creating your Kafka cluster, set up a Kafka topic effortlessly. Upstash Kafka provides default configurations for the number of partitions and retention policy, simplifying the setup process.

## 4. Connect and Interact with Your Kafka Cluster

You're now ready to connect to your Kafka cluster using various Kafka clients. These clients enable you to both produce and consume data from your Kafka topic. This step empowers you to create real-time event-driven applications and services both using Kafka and RisingWave.

With these four steps, you are on your way to leveraging the capabilities of Upstash Kafka. Explore the full potential of event streaming for your applications!
