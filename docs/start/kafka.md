# Install Kafka

Kafka is the most popular event streaming platform in the industry. If you want to install Kafka on your own machine, then we recommend that you read the [official guide](https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart). It will take you about 10 minutes to install Kafka and get the service running.

If you don't want to install Kafka locally, then you may consider using cloud services. Two of the serverless Kafka(-like) services we have tested and recommended are [Upstash](https://upstash.com/) and WarpStream (https://www.warpstream.com/).

:::tip Note 1
Please note that we recommend Upstash and WarpStream in the tutorial because they are **free** and **easy-to-use**. If you want to use these services in production, please reach out to them directly for more information.

:::tip Note 2
If you know some other services that are free and easy-to-use, and can directly connect to RisingWave, please let us know. We will add a guide for it.
