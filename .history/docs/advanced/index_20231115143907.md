# Index

In a database, users can create indexes on tables to accelerate queries. Indexing in RisingWave is similar to traditional databases and is designed to speed up random queries.

Users can build indexes on tables and materialized views.

Currently, RisingWave does not support cross-table indexes. This means an index can only be created on a single table or materialized view.
