# Index

In a database, users can create indexes on tables to accelerate queries. Indexing in RisingWave is similar to traditional databases and is designed to speed up random queries. Users can build indexes on **tables and materialized views**.

## Syntax

```
CREATE INDEX index_name ON object_name ( index_column [ ASC | DESC ], [, ...] )
[ INCLUDE ( include_column [, ...] ) ]
[ DISTRIBUTED BY ( distributed_column [, ...] ) ];
```
